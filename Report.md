# Snake_ECE287

For our ECE 287 Project, we decided to implement the famous game "Snake" in Verilog, via Quartus II. All programming was done on a Altera DE2-115 board. 

### Background

"Snake" is a video game where a player controls a snake that moves around to eat objects in order to become bigger. As the snake gets bigger, the harder it becomes to control that snake. The player loses if the snake hits itself, or a border. The player wins if it eats all of the objects. 

## Design
#### Summary

To complete this project, we used:
  * Quartus II
  * Altera DE2-115 board, power cable, and USB cable
  * PS/2 Keyboard
  * VGA cable and monitor
